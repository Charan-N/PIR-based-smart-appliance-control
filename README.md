# PIR-based-smart-appliance-control(BETA)
This is the code to my mini project i.e PIR based smart appliance control.<br>
The project is vastly in use already, but this project is used in big halls and classrooms to save electricity.<br>
Another feature is that the appliances are turned ON only where a person is(if there's only one guy).<br><br>

only code is uploaded for now(still requires more refinement), other schematics and diagrams will be added later!
