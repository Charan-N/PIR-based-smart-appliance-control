# PIR-based-smart-appliance-control(BETA)
This is the code to my mini project i.e PIR based smart appliance control
The project is vastly in use already, but this project is used in big halls and classrooms to save electricity.
Another feature is that the appliances are turned ON only where a person is(if there's only one guy).

only code is uploaded for now(still requires more refinement), other schematics and diagrams will be added later!
